* Conda instructions (Mac, Linux)

These instructions assume a working miniconda or anaconda installation.

First, you'll need to set up a conda environment for the projects: 

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
conda create -n minecraft-assignments python=3.6 numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn ffmpeg openjdk
# This is a line you'll be typing in every new terminal window
source activate minecraft-assignments

#+END_SRC

We are using the CrowdAI conda recipe for Malmo, so we'll need to install that separately:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
conda config --add channels conda-forge 
conda install -c crowdai malmo

#+END_SRC

Next we'll throw in pulp and the z3-solver package, which have no Conda recipe, along with some Python helpers used by various development tools:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash

pip install pulp z3-solver flake8 mypy jedi autopep8 yapf black pylint
#+END_SRC

In non-Malmo exercises, you'll need to run this in any Terminal window you want to use (or use emacs's =pyenv-venv= package, or...):
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# One time in each terminal window you open
source activate minecraft-assignments 
# Anytime you want to run a program
python test_path_planning.py # For example
#+END_SRC

In the exercises which use Malmo, you'll need two terminal windows.  In one, launch Minecraft:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
source activate minecraft-assignments
cd "$MALMO_MINECRAFT_ROOT" && ./launchClient.sh

#+END_SRC

In the other, run your Python script (make sure the minecraft-assignments environment is active here too!):

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
source activate minecraft-assignments
python mission_script.py

#+END_SRC
