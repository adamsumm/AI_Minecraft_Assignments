This is my adaptation of the material developed by Adam Summerville and myself for doing significant, motivated AI programming assignments.
It is specialized for my syllabus for Pomona's course CSCI 151 PO Artificial Intelligence.

Setting up the environment is detailed in [[file:setup.org][Setup]].

The homework is split into six major assignments:

1. Path and task planning, in two parts:
  - [[file:Pathfinding/path-planning-four-ways.org][Path Planning Four Ways]]
  - [[file:CraftingPlanning/crafting-with-iw.org][Crafting with Iterative Widening]]
2. Linear programming with applications to metric task planning, also in two parts:
  - [[file:SchedulingLinProg/linprog_castle.org][Building a Castle with Linear Programming]]
  - [[file:SchedulingLinProg/intprog_planning.org][Integer Programming for Production Planning]]
3. Machine learning with an application towards learning heuristics to guide search, in one part:
  - [[file:CraftingRegressionEstimation/learning-heuristics.org][Learning Heuristics]]
4. SAT/SMT for a logical framing of puzzles and planning problems, in two parts:
  - [[file:SATSMT/redstone.org][Redstone Puzzles]]
  - [[file:SATSMT/smt-planning.org][Planning via SMT]]
5. Reinforcement learning for an agent to figure out crafting plans on its own, in one part:
  - [[file:ReinforcementLearning/rl.org][Crafting Policies with Reinforcement Learning]]
6. And convolutional recurrent neural networks to learn how to caption Minecraft screenshots, in one part:
  - [[file:ObserveAndCaption/caption.org][Generating Captions with Recurrent CNNs]]
